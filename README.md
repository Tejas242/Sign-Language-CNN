# Sign Language Detection Model ðŸ¤–âœ‹

Welcome to the Sign Language Detection Model repository! This project leverages Keras to recognize sign language from static images.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Image Classification**: Detects hand gestures into sign language letters.
- **Built with Keras**: Simple and effective model.

## ðŸ¤” How It Works
The model processes static images of hand signs and classifies them into corresponding sign language letters.
